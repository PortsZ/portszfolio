        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Pursuit of Academic Excellence</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          The start of my academic journey was marked by promise and a passion for technology. In 2017, I decided that Computer Engineering would be my path. For two and a half years, I was immersed in the universe of programming and engineering, soaking up all the knowledge I could. Everything changed, however, with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic.

        <p className="text-lg">
          With the halt of academic activities in 2020, I saw an opportunity for personal growth. I turned my living room into a private classroom, where I delved into the world of finance. I leveraged my programming skills to develop trading bots, and dove deep into stock and options trading.

        <p className="text-lg">
          In 2021, the university resumed its activities, adapting to the new normal with online classes and three semesters in a single year. But life, unpredictable as ever, had other plans for me. The loss of my father to COVID-19 forced me to focus on my family&apos;s financial sustainability, a responsibility I took on with sorrow but determination.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Opportunity in the Cryptocurrency Market</h2>
        <p className="text-lg">
          In this challenging landscape, a light appeared at the end of the tunnel. An investor approached me, interested in the skills I had acquired during my self-taught journey in finance. Together, we embarked on the adventure of cryptocurrencies. From an initial investment of $600,000, we nearly tripled that amount. However, professional and interpersonal differences led to the end of this collaboration in mid-2022.

        <p className="text-lg">
          Determined to give a new direction to my career, I dove headfirst into web development and created Antares, a software aimed at dimensioning solar kits. Combining Next.js and Laravel technologies, I developed a subscription service that not only serves as an amazing portfolio but also as a functional product that is already gaining its first customers.

        <p className="text-lg">
          Away from the codes and numbers, I&apos;m a multifaceted individual. My hobbies include music—I play guitar, bass, and a bit of piano—and competitive games. I&apos;m fluent in multiple languages, and my rapid learning capability is perhaps my greatest asset. I&apos;m self-taught, have a knack for absorbing new knowledge, and I believe my child-like curiosity is one of my most valuable qualities.
